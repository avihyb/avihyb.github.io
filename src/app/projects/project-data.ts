        description: 'A digital version of the ancient game Hnefatafl, also known as Viking Chess. Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented using JavaFX. The game is played on a 11x11 board with two players: the attackers and the defenders. The attackers win by capturing the king, while the defenders win by moving the king to one of the four corner squares. The game features a custom board design, piece movement, and game logic. The game also includes a custom AI that can play against the player. The AI uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move. The game also includes a custom game mode that allows the player to play against another player on the same computer',
